#GOrbit

Simple HTTP MJPEG streaming for V4L2 webcams and pan/tilt control (for Logitech速 Orbit AF only). Written in Go.


## Requirements
* Own a V4L2 compatible camera and install v4l2 packages.
* (optional) For controlling Logitech速 Orbit AF, scroll down to [the Orbit section](#logitech-orbit-af-control).

## Install
Download [latest release](https://github.com/filiptc/gorbit/releases/latest) for your architecture (Linux only).
Extract and run binary.

*Note:* I can only provide X64 and ARM binaries for the time being. If you need a binary for a different architecture
 you will need to [build from sources](#build-from-sources) yourself.

## Usage
#### CLI controls:
* Reset pan/tilt: `gorbit control -r`
* Pan (100 steps*): `gorbit control -p 100`
* Tilt (100 steps*): `gorbit control -t 100`

(* 1 step = 1 / 64 degree)

#### Web controls:
* Start server: `gorbit serve`
* Open `http://localhost:8001` on your browser
* Click on a point in image to pan/tilt, so that that point becomes the new center.

## Build from sources
Install Go on your system. Run `go install github.com/filiptc/gorbit`. Binary will be available on `$GOPATH/bin/gorbit`.
Be aware that the cross compiling will not work for the time being, due to CGO compiler limitations. If you need to
compile for another architecture, you will need to do so from within it.


## Logitech速 Orbit AF control
In order to correctly make GOrbit control pan/tilt/reset, you need to install uvcdynctrl
(`sudo apt-get install uvcdynctrl` on Debian) and import Logitech速 controls. This can be done by running
`uvcdynctrl --import=/path/to/logitech.xml`. The default file provided by the uvcdynctrl package works for
pan/tilt, but doesn't allow for pan/tilt simultaneous reset. Download the following [logitech.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llmike/v4l2-tools/master/libwebcam-src-0.2.4/uvcdynctrl/data/046d/logitech.xml)
to allow pan/tilt resets.

## TODOs
* Write tests
* Neaten up UI
* Allow providing all config values on execution through CLI
* Image text overlays (timestamp, camera, etc.)
